# Salt and Sanctuary - Shimmering Pearl Farm Macro

Macro created to help folks farm Shimering Pearl, King's Order and Lord's Order in Salt and Sanctuary.

### Necessary Modules:
- pyautogui
- keyboard
- time
- threading

### Recomendations
- Use a 2nd player stationary at the Mal's Floating Castle shrine (used to teleport without using any item)

### How to use
- In the *script* section `Teleport to sanctuary` use the default settings if you are using a 2nd player to teleport to, otherwise **comment** this section and use the functions `q()`, `e()` and `item()` to select and use a ***Bell of Return*** to teleport back to the shrine;
- In the *script* section `EDIT HERE` you can create various sequences for different characters to get ready to fight the ***Crypt Keeper***;
- All the movements in the macro to get near the farming place consider a character with ***weight*** between 60% and 75%.

After the *script* editing:
- Open the macro and go to Mal's Floating Castle shrine;
- Leave the 2nd player in the shrine and go fight the ***Crypt Keeper***;
- After defeating the mob and collect the loot press the char **"I"** on your keyboard to start the macro with your custom settings.

## Enjoy the Farm :smile: ðŸ˜„
